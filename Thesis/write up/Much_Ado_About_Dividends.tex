\small{
Dividend paying stock are commonly employed to introduce an income
component into equity portfolios, with the promise of achieving higher
total returns while managing lower risk. This study examines globally
traded dividend portfolios constructed using high yield or dividend
growth signals. It is observed that the performance of dividend
portfolios varies across geographies;however, high yield strategies
consistently provide investors with the highest aggregate returns in
advanced economies over time. When index returns are stratified, it
becomes apparent that during periods of low volatility, high yield
strategies outperform dividend growth strategies, and all portfolios
yield higher returns during interest rate hiking cycles than during
cutting cycles. The consistency of returns from these portfolios over
time is found to be poor, with South African strategies showing the
highest level of consistency over the past decade when assessed on a
rolling basis. In evaluating portfolio risk by geography, we note that
advanced markets have historically experienced fewer drawdowns, whilst
emerging markets and South Africa have exhibited seemingly improving
risk measures within the same period.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This paper seeks to investigate the return signalling cue of dividend
paying stock. The value of dividends towards shareholders has long been
debated with academics and practitioners providing evidence for their
irrelevance and relevance. Miller \& Rock
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-miller1985dividend}{1985}) proposed the dividend
irrelevance theorem that essentially argues that dividend payments were
irrelevant as this detracted from the shareholder value as wealth is
affected by the income a firm generates, not the way the firm
distributes that income. Against this, Gordon
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gordon1962}{1962}) argued that certain cash
flows should be preferred by investors as opposed to the riskier capital
gains. Moreover, when we consider that the MM theory was developed under
unrealistic conditions therefore real world constraints such as taxes
and transactions cost that are major considerations when determining
asset allocation can cause investors to prefer some exposure to dividend
paying stock in their portfolio. Consequently theories such as
information asymmetries, tax considerations, return signalling all give
convincing arguments of dividend payment address some real world
considerations. Overall, if we are assume that markets are efficient and
the value of a stock is a function of its future dividends, then stock
that do not pay dividends should have a value of zero unless there is
some expectation of the future reciepts of investment is said stock
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-campbell2017financial}{Campbell, 2017}). This
brings in the question, if there is new information that affects a
companies future cash flows, what will happen to stock price? Event
studies on dividend payments address this and often times it is noted
that the payment of dividends leads to a decrease in prices thus stock
valuation. Suwanna (\protect\hyperlink{ref-suwanna2012impacts}{2012})
shows that dividend announcement decrease share prices to the value of
the dividend. This could be that dividend are a capital budgeting
decision and their payment reduces retained earnings and consequently
affects that the share price.

This study provides an extensive investigation into the return signaling
of dividend portfolios. Firstly, we address the question of when
dividend portfolios work. The analysis delves into the performance and
risk attributes of globally traded dividend portfolios across different
geographical regions, market cycles, and interest rate regimes. We find
that return characteristics of dividend portfolios vary greatly, with
advanced economy high-yield portfolios returning multiples during the
sample period, whilst emerging market and South African dividend
portfolios fail to deliver stratifying excess return over the same
period. More broadly, dividend portfolios, whether high yield (HY) or
dividend growth (DG), all offer fail to offer downside protection during
periods of high market volatility. Second, we observe that dividend
portfolios provide the best returns during periods of interest rate
hiking cycles. We note that because dividend yield is categorized as a
proxy for value, such assets are primed to outperform growth stocks as
investors move away from risky assets within asset classes.

Next, the study also evaluates the consistency of performance among
dividend portfolios using a rolling information ratio. From this dynamic
measure, we note the inherent lack of consistency in all dividend
portfolios. However, coupled with drawdowns experienced in different
jurisdictions, we acknowledge that advanced market dividend portfolios
experience the least variation in drawdowns compared to emerging
markets. The results indicate that both growth and high-yield dividend
portfolios tend to under perform relative to their benchmarks, raising
questions about their consistency in delivering positive returns. We
then move on to how dividend portfolios work, with the goal of
constructing a portfolio that can best harness the existing premium. We
use share data from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), with our
benchmark being the JSE Top 40 index. We construct four portfolios
varying in complexity, with the most advanced accounting for price
momentum and dividend payout sustainability.

\hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

As summarized by Vanguard (2017) succinctly, ``the focus of high
dividend-yielding equities is often their income potential, but higher
yields do not necessarily translate into higher returns. This is
because, for all companies, whether or not to pay a dividend is a
capital budgeting decision. When a stock goes ex-dividend, its price
falls by the same amount as the dividend payment. Therefore, no wealth
is created through paying a dividend; rather, the payment reduces
retained earnings. This means that share price should decrease
accordingly thus share holders should be worse off.

Thus, brings in the question of why dividend strategies provide for a
return signalling cue. First, there should exists a rationale beyond
dividend payment effect on share price, perhaps in line with theories
regarding dividend relevance. Second, if the signals provide some type
excess return beyond their market index, does it continuously provide
the premium to be harvested by a systematic investment strategy.

\hypertarget{research-aim}{%
\section{Research Aim}\label{research-aim}}

The aim of this study is to test whether and why dividend payout
strategies contain a profitable investment signal to potential
investors. There exists various international studies testing this
hypothesis across geographies, underscoring that dividend can be used as
a profitable future return signal. Studies conducted for the South
African market employ methodologies that do not inform readers on
mechanisms behind why the dividend signal works or provide an indication
of returns for a systematic dividend investment strategy. We aim to fill
this gap by testing various portfolios constructed based on dividend
information in South Africa.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}}

\hypertarget{what-are-dividends}{%
\subsection{What are dividends}\label{what-are-dividends}}

Dividends constitute a form of capital distribution by corporations
towards shareholders. They exist in various forms, such as cash, stock,
liquidating, scrip, or property dividends Baker \& Powell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker1999corporate}{1999}), of which cash
dividends and share repurchases being the most commonly used in
practice. Within cash dividends, regular dividends are widely used by
corporations and payment frequency across jurisdictions. The decision to
issue dividends is typically made by the board of directors, and
approved by shareholders, however practiced more in Europe and less so
in the United States. The payout policy policy of a corporation, which
are guiding principles for management and board of directors towards
capital distributions considers company investment and is closely
watched by investors and analysts. As such, management strives to grow
or maintain a certain level of dividend payouts as this signals firm
growth and investors share of profitability in the company.

\hypertarget{theorectical-arguments-on-dividend-payments}{%
\subsection{Theorectical Arguments on Dividend
Payments}\label{theorectical-arguments-on-dividend-payments}}

Given the apparent decrease in shareholder value, the logical question
has encouraged a long running debate on dividend relevance and
irrelevance. In 1961, Miller \& Rock
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-miller1985dividend}{1985}) opined that dividends
are irrelevant (MM theory), he argued that shareholders are indifferent
to dividend payments, thus implying that there is no optimal dividend
policy and that all dividend policies are equally good and payments of
dividends could easily be reinvested in shares and make no difference to
share holder wealth. However, the MM theorem fails to consider
real-world market imperfections that may give relevance to dividend
payments. The bird in the arguments opposes the MM theory, suggesting
that investor would prefer to receive less risky cash flow in the form
of dividends instead of potential capital gains at some point in the
future (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gordon1962}{Gordon, 1962}). This
permeates to the cost of equity, since dividends are less risky,
companies that issue more dividends should have higher share prices.
However, propoents of the MM theory contend this suggesting the risk of
future cash flow is affected by the payment of dividend, leading to
negative effects on share prices after the ex-dividend date. The
dividend puzzle considers real world constraints and gives an
interesting take on its relevance and irrelevance, by suggesting that
dividends reduce equity value and make investors worse off; however, are
a reward to investors who bear the risk associated with their
investments as it provides an additional source of return on investment
from a share Black (\protect\hyperlink{ref-black1996dividend}{1996}).
Various literature has made convincing arguments for corporations to pay
dividends which include tax considerations, dividend signalling and
agency costs in issuing dividends .

Taxe considerations argue in favor for dividend relevance. Across
jurisdiction dividends have different tax treatments to capital gains
and often tax at a higher income tax rate, thus investors that have
higher tax rates choose stocks with lower dividend payouts and
transversly pushes up the stock price, this is called the clientele
effect Baker \& Powell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker1999corporate}{1999}). However a major
pushback emanates from proponents of the MM theory, that suggest the
client effect causes major substitution effect, meaning that if
companies change their dividend policy, investors with preferential tax
treatment will simply allocate more capital to that stock and those out
of favor will sell their shares. Given the large number of investors
versus listed companies the process is instantaneously causing a net
zero effect on prices(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker1999corporate}{Baker
\& Powell, 1999}). Second, flotation costs refer to the opportunity
costs incurred by a firm when paying dividends. Through distributing
dividends, companies forego opportunities to expand their operations
using retained earnings. In a world without flotation costs, as
suggested by the MM theorem, management would be indifferent between
issuing dividends and borrowing from the market thus have no effect on
shares prices. However, in reality, external financing comes at a higher
cost, leading to trade-offs in dividend policy decisions and ultimately
share prices.

Information asymmetry between shareholders and managers is another
factor that gives relevance to dividend payments. Managers of businesses
have greater knowledge of operations thus value of a business at any
given point more than shareholders. As such, investors rely on dividend
announcements to assess a company's valuation. Dividend signaling
conveys information about the company's quality Baker \& Powell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker1999corporate}{1999}). Investors compare
dividend announcements to historical levels while considering company
fundamentals. However, a major concern towards its ability to be
``gamed' by management, making the dividend signal imperfect for
determining share prices. Principal agency issues may give another
reason for issuance of dividends. The free cash flow hypothesis suggests
that dividend payments force management to raise capital from external
sources, which increases borrowing costs and scrutiny from capital
markets. This, in turn, reduces management's ability to make sub optimal
investments and aligning management and shareholder objectives
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker2009understanding}{\textbf{baker2009understanding?}}).
Supporters of this theory ascertain that dividends payments by the
mechanism encourage good business practices.

\hypertarget{investment-strategies-from-dividend-signals}{%
\subsection{Investment Strategies from Dividend
signals}\label{investment-strategies-from-dividend-signals}}

The amount of literature regarding dividend relevance leaves readers
wiser. Thus, it can be reasonably concluded that the past performance of
dividend-based portfolio strategies could be understood by using proxy
arguments (as opposed to it being considered an attractive feature in
itself). For example, high dividend-paying companies could proxy for the
quality of management structures over time (through their ability to
consistently afford dividend payments) or similarly point to prudent
cash-flow management capabilities. Therefore, from the perspective of an
investor, the dividend yield can be used as a signal in constructing an
investment strategy. O'higgins \& Downes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-o1991beating}{1991}) proposed an investment
strategy which used companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA) called the ``Dogs of the Dow'' (DOD). By ranking 30
companies by dividend yield and including only the 10 highest-yielding
shares in a portfolio, this achieved a return higher than the DJIA
(16.6\% per annum versus the DJIA's 10.4\%). This had lower risk than
the DJIA, thus achieving a higher Sharpe Ratio. Testing O'higgins \&
Downes (\protect\hyperlink{ref-o1991beating}{1991})'s strategy resulted
in ``Beat the Dow 5,'' which involved annually investing in only the
five lowest-priced of the HY10 shares each year, in other words, high
dividend yield. This strategy gave superior returns of 19.4\% versus the
DJIA. As opined by Gardner, Gardner \& Maranjian
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gardner2002motley}{2002}), this strategy
leverages the fact that low-priced stocks experience the most
volatility, by courting future volatility in the 10 stocks that have
some potential upside, expecting their stock prices to rise in return.

Many more studies emerged examining the DOD strategy or similar
high-yield dividend strategies, in different time periods and regions,
consistently showing superior risk-adjusted returns compared to the
market index. Examples of such studies include Lemmon \& Nguyen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lemmon2015dividend}{2015}) in Hong Kong,
BrzeszczyÅ„ski \& Gajdka
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-brzeszczynski2007dividend}{2007}) in Poland,
Visscher \& Filbeck (\protect\hyperlink{ref-visscher2003dividend}{2003})
in Canada, Filbeck \& Visscher
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-filbeck1997}{1997}) in Britain, and Wang,
Larsen, Ainina, Akhbari \& Gressis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-wang2011dogs}{2011}) in China. More recently,
Filbeck, Holzhauer \& Zhao
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-filbeck2017dividend}{2017}) investigated the
performance of DOD against a high-yield portfolio of Fortune Most
Desired Companies (MAC) compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
the S\&P 500. The study found significantly higher risk-adjusted returns
for the DOD strategy. In South Africa, Fakir \& others
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fakir2013dividend}{2013}) employs a parametric
approach to investigate dividends as an investment strategy. However
there are issues with such methodology.First, on the JSE the
signal-to-noise ratio on regressed stock returns is low, implying that
the modeler's ability to accurately attribute return differences to a
variable of interest (e.g., DY) is severely undermined. This is often
rectified by considering returns at a lower frequency (e.g., monthly or
even annually) to partially control for noise. Also, studies using
parametric techniques seek to infer statistical significance, often
leaving the more applied reader with limited knowledge gained as to the
actual profitability of considering said signal from a portfolio
context. Secondly, returns tend to be non-normally distributed and have
large outliers. The combination of these problems can easily lead to a
small sample size, non-normally distributed, and noisy inference series
(especially in a local application) with limited practical application.
In practice, subset portfolios are used, which are compared in-sample
performances. While not necessarily providing readers with a parametric
significance test, portfolio risk and return measures based on
systematically constructed portfolios serve to provide valuable
insights. Various such applications exist in the literature. Damodaran
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-damodaran2004investment}{2004}) constructs top
decile portfolios based on trailing DY at the beginning of each year
from 1952 to 2001. For the last sample period (1991 - 2001), it is found
that the highest dividend-yielding portfolio outperformed the lowest by
about 3\%. Conover, Jensen \& Simpson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-conover2016difference}{2016}) find that
portfolios constructed from high-dividend payers return over 1.5\% more
per year than non-dividend payers, in addition to having lower risk.

Dividend signaling can be catergorized in two forms, namely high yield
(HY) or dividend growth per share (DG). Whereas HY confirms is typically
used as a value proxy, it's a poor proxy given its relation to price if
we consider a constant payout ratio. For this reason, the use of DGPS
provides attributes that aim to curtail negative aspects of HY. That is,
DGPS for corporations, and unlike the dividend yield, it is not affected
by price but maintains properties that allow for inference into
management quality. As management is aware of the signaling effect of
dividends, this may induce the value trap, forcing management to
continually increase dividends to maintain a certain valuation. However,
such companies are more vulnerable to facing financial distress.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

We employ dividend signals to rank our assets within our selected
universe to construct portfolios that offer higher risk adjusted return
than the market index. We consider a dividend yield ranking selecting
the top 20 stock, dividend growth per share and selecting the top 20
stock, an extension of the dividend portfolios by adding a price
momentum filter and a sustainability portfolio that aims penalizes stock
that have unsustainable dividend practices.

Optimizing an asset portfolio involves carefully calibrating the
trade-offs between risk and expected returns. In achieving the ultimate
goal of the study, we aim to investigate how different risk models can
provide significant cues in forming dividend strategies. To this end, we
employ Minimum Variance, Equal Risk Contribution, and Minimum
Volatility. Additionally, this study incorporates more refinements
models like Risk Efficiency and makes use of proprietary software-based
approaches, specifically drawing upon the Barras risk model.Unique to
the Barras model is the introduction of the Max Utility Operator, which
allows for a more sophisticated interpretation of risk by focusing not
only on the total risk but also the active risk associated with each
asset. This dual perspective enables the construction of a more
versatile covariance matrix, thereby enriching the portfolio
optimization process. The following sections analytically describes the
optimization problem and risk models used in the study.

\hypertarget{security-selection-methodology}{%
\section{Security Selection
Methodology}\label{security-selection-methodology}}

We will employ a practical approach in evaluating dividend signals that
involves constructing subset portfolios and compare in sample
performance as suggested by Damodaran
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-damodaran2004investment}{2004}) .We will rank
stock within our selected universe by dividend signals, namely dividend
yield (DY) and dividend growth per share (DGPS). First, we rebalance at
the end of March and September and construct fully invested, long only
portfolios. On each re balancing date, we take the top 100 stocks by
market capitalization (MC), and then select the top quintile (20 stocks)
based on the our signal scores. We then apply 25 basis trading costs to
both buying and selling of stocks, and we will then use total return
values, adjust for stock splits and other distorting effects on prices
to calculate portfolio returns. We also carefully apply back-dated
adjustments to dividends paid to accurately arrive at on-the-day
dividends and actual closing prices when calculating our Dividend Yield
and Dividend Per Share Growth measures.

We also apply at each re balancing on the risk models mentioned
previously. The optimization are constrained to have minimum and maximum
weight exposure of 0.5 and 1.5 times the equal weighted alternative.
With our quintile portfolios, this implies weights ranging between 2.5\%
and 7.5\%. For the Barra Max utility model with we use a risk aversion
parameter of Common Factor Risk Aversion ratio we'll use will be: 0.0075
\& asset specific R.A ratio of 1

Following this we will construct back-tests on the subset of dividend
signal portfolios.

The Standard portfolios considered as follows

The Standard Dividend Yield Portfolio: uses the 12 month mean trailing
dividend yield measure in its construction. - This avoids biasing to
stocks that experienced recent share price declines (negative momentum),
as would be done when considering on the day DY values; - This will be
treated as the vanilla DY signal portfolio.

The DPSG signal portfolio is constructed by considering the growth of
company dividends mentioned above on a 1, 3 and 5 year basis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the three and five year measure, we only consider stocks that had
  positive share payment growth over the period considered.
\item
  E.g., if a stock had a DPS decrease in year 2, even if it has an
  increased dividend payment over three years
\item
  we set this value to zero.
\item
  This has the effect of rewarding consistency, but also reduces the
  sample set substantially if the period under consideration increases
\end{itemize}

Momentum Adjusted DY and DPSG portfolios extend both our DY and DPSG
portfolios by applying a momentum adjusted filter for each. We use the
following approach to make the adjustments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Step 1: Rank our sample (top 100 by MC) by risk-adjusted price
  momentum and consider the top half.
\item
  Note that we do not use the ``traditional'' definition of momentum (12
  - 1 month return as introduced by Jegadeesh and Titman), but rather
  use a risk-adjusted measure for momentum. Here we consider the 90 day
  moving average return series to the same 90 day standard deviation for
  each stock.
\item
  Step 2: Rank our sample by either the DY or DPSG measure, and pick the
  top 20 stocks.
\end{itemize}

Sustainability Adjusted DY and DPSG portfolios extend our DY and DPSG
signals by considering dividend payout ratios (DPR). DPR measures how
much of a company's profit is paid out in dividends. We construct this
signal by removing from the top 100 companies the 20 with the highest
DPR scores. The aim of this filter is simply to avoid the most
unsustainable stocks from a dividend payment perspective - thus
systematically avoiding stocks that are most likely to cut dividends in
the future, leading to a reactionary capital gain loss (as commonly
experienced in practice). - Step 1: Rank our sample (top 100 by MC) by
the payout ratio using normalized earnings and consider only the bottom
80 (lower DPR is more sustainable). This measure is calculated by
considering the fraction (percentage) of net income a firm pays to its
shareholders in dividends, calculated as: Total Common Cash Dividends /
Normalized Earnings. - Step 2: Rank our sample by either the DY or DPSG
measures, and pick the top 20 stocks for each.

For completeness we compare the performance of these constructed
portfolios to a standard value signal (PE) and a momentum signal,
constructed as a composite 60, 120 and 240 day risk-adjusted momentum
score for each stock. We next compare the absolute returns as well as
the risk-adjusted performance and drawdowns of each of these portfolios.
We then consider turnover and tracking error, before briefly showing the
sector exposure of some of the different strategies. \newpage

\hypertarget{portfolio-optimization}{%
\section{Portfolio Optimization}\label{portfolio-optimization}}

Portfolio optimization consists of determining a set of assets, and
their respective portfolio participation weights, which satisfy the
investor concerning the combination of risk-return trade-off. Markowitz
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-markowitz1959portfolio}{1959}) proposed the
Mean-Variance (MV) model in which the expected return is given by the a
measure of the historical data of the stock's return. For our study we
geometrically chain return to measure true effects on portfolio returns
overtime. The risk is calculated by the variance of these returns. The
MV model treats returns of individual assets as random variables and to
adopt the value of expected return and variance in order to quantify the
return and investment risk, respectively
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-zhang2018portfolio}{Zhang, Li \& Guo, 2018}).
\begin{align}
\mu \quad = \quad w^TR \notag \\
\sigma^2 \quad  = \quad w^T\sum \notag
w\end{align} The resulting objective function is to maximize return
given a certain level of risk and constraint: \begin{align}
Maximise \ w^TR \sum w<=\sigma^2\ and\ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}w{_i}=1 \notag
\end{align}

Linear constraints are generally included in MV portfolio optimization.
Optimization typically assume that portfolio weights sum to 1 and are
non negative. This defines a linear equality constraint on the
optimization. Another constraint typically used is no-short-selling
condition is a set of sign constraints or linear inequalities. This
reflects avoidance of unlimited liability investment often required in
institutional contexts.

This study will use a an extension of the MV that uses risk preferences
to determine optimum allocation of assets within a portfolio. Barra
definition of portfolio risk extends that from the Modern Portfolio
theory. It defines risk as the decomposition of the variance of returns.
Using Barra multifactor model, the return (r) of a portfolio can be
decomposed into both a common factor return (Xf) and asset specific
return (u) components as: \begin{align} 
r= X_{F} + u \notag
\end{align}

The multi-factor approach entails the creation of a factor covariance
matrix. This is a short term risk forecast that describes trade off of
each common factor within the model. This approach requires periodic
return calculation to these exposures. The upshot is that the
methodology provides an forecast of each assets specific risk.

The covariance matrix is defined as:

\begin{align}
 XFX^T + D \label{eq1} \notag
\end{align}

where X = n x k matrix of asset exposures to the factors. F = k x k
positive semi-definite factor covariance matrix, and D = n Ã— n positive
semi-definite covariance matrix representing a forecast of asset
specific risk.

Expressing portfolio risk in decomposition allows for portfolio manager
to optimize portfolio from either a total risk perspective or an active
risk perspective. In total risk, portfolio holdings are only considered,
and the benchmark holdings are treated as irrelevant for optimization
purposes. Whereas in active risk, the tracking error in which the
difference between the portfolio holdings and those of the benchmark is
given primary consideration in the optimization problem.

\begin{align}
Total\ Risk : h^T(\lambda_FXFX^T + \lambda_D)h \notag \\ \quad \quad 
Active \ Risk : (h-h_B)^T(\lambda_FXFX^T+\lambda_DD)(h-h_B) \notag
\end{align}

where \begin{align}
\lambda_f  =  common \ factor\ risk\ aversion\ parameter \notag,\\ \lambda_d =  specific\ risk\ aversion\ parameter \notag,\\h  =  n * 1 \ vector\ of\ managed\ portfolioâ€™s\ holdings\notag,\\ and \notag \\h_B = vector \ normal\ (benchmark)\ portfolioâ€™s\ holdings \notag 
\end{align}

The introduction of risk aversion parameters into Barra's portfolio
optimization is a form of a max utility operator that allows the
portfolio managers to incorporate a numeric representation of personal
risk preferences into the portfolio optimization process\footnote{see
  \url{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521921002556}
  for a detailed explanation on advantages of using maximum utility
  operators to efficiently factor investor risk preferences}. It also
provides the opportunity to quantify relative aversion to common factor
risk vis-Ã -vis specific risk. Consequently, these risk aversion
parameters are important tools that are available to assist the
portfolio manager in the construction of an optimal portfolio that is
consistent with their goals.

\hypertarget{equal-risk-contribution-erc}{%
\subsection{Equal Risk Contribution
(ERC)}\label{equal-risk-contribution-erc}}

Equal risk contribution is a return free approach that seeks to equalize
risk contributions from the universe of selected assets thus ensuring it
is fully diversified from a risk perspective. Let sigma measure
portfolio risk and C(x) defined to be the risk contribution of asset i.
If the portfolio risk is measured as by the variance of its return then
is;

\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = x^TQ{x}\notag \\ and \ C_i(x)= x_i(Qx)_i \notag \\
\quad where\ (Qx)_i =\sum_{i = 1}^{N}Q_ijxj \notag
\end{align}

\begin{align}
x^{ERC} \ satisfies \ C_i(x^{ERC}) = (R(x^{ERC})/N) \ for \ i = 1,...., N. \notag
\end{align}

From this we conclude that the variance and standard deviation measures
are the same for and when can then only the variance risk measure
appreciating that all results apply equally to standard deviation.

\hypertarget{tax-considerations}{%
\section{Tax considerations}\label{tax-considerations}}

Portfolio theory was developed in a perfect world without friction. In
practice, frictions need to be considered and in portfolio construction
this often entails considering the effect of taxes on income and capital
gains as they can erode returns and significantly alter risks and return
characteristics of shares. The contribution of dividends and capital
gains to total return can lead to varying tax inefficiencies for shares
as most jurisdictions imposed higher taxes than on capital gains.
Therefore shares with higher contribution of dividends will be less tax
efficient than those with a higher capital gains component and with
timing most jurisdictions tax dividends in the year that they are
receive\footnote{See Deloitte's tax guides and country highlights:
  \url{https://dits.deloitte.com/\#TaxGuides}}.

Jurisdictional laws can also affect the distribution of taxable returns
amongst shares depending on their class namely ordinary shares or
preferred shares. Preferred shares are viewed as a substitute for bonds
and income from preferred shares are often given tax at a lower rate
than those from dividends from ordinary shares.

We will not survey global tax regimes or incorporate all potential tax
complexities into the portfolio construction but assume a high level
commonalities exists amongst all jurisdictions this study uses. This is
a reasonable assumption considering the summary of taxes on dividends
and capital gains from major economies. For simplicity, we will assume a
basic tax regime includes the key elements of investment-related taxes
that are representative of what a typical taxable asset owner of a
global portfolio will contend with. The proposed methodology to employ
on the dividend portfolios use the following methodology.

\begin{align}
r_{a t}=p_d r_{p t}\left(1-t_d\right)+p_a r_{p t}\left(1-t_{c g}\right) \notag
\end{align}

where r\_\{at\} the after tax return, p\_d= the proportion of r\_\{pt\}
attributed to dividend income, p\_a= the proportion of r\_\{pt\}
attributed to price appreciation, t\_d= the dividend tax rate and
t\_\{cg\}= the capital gains tax rate

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Our metric of interest in this study is the excess return of dividend
portfolios over the period 04/01/01--06/30/23, with the start date and
the end date purely driven by data availability on the selected dividend
indices at the time of writing. We obtained historical daily price data
of the dividend portfolios from Bloomberg\footnote{see \ref{reftab} for
  a detailed guide to indices used and codenames used later in the
  results and analysis}. We also retrieved geographic specific data on
index on volatility and interest rates to segment some of our analysis
to reflect market cycles and interest rate regimes performane. That is,
Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) VIX Index for the US and EM,
V2X for Europe, IVUK for UK and JALSH VR for SA volatility proxies. For
interest rate data we considered policy rates for central banks for
instruments geography within our study, thse are the Federal Fund rate
for the US and EM, Minimum Deposit Financing Rate for the EU, Bank of
England Bank Rate and the South African Reserve Bank Repo rate. To this
end, we calculate our excess returns, we geometrically chain the excess
returns for the different periods before annualizing. This produces
comparable cumulative annualized excess return (CAER) results, defined
as: \begin{align}
C A E R=\left[\prod_{t=1}^n\left(1+E R_t\right)\right]^{\frac{222}{n}}-1 \notag
\end{align}

Our rule to identifying volatility periods either high volatility
(Hi-vol) or low volatility (Lo-vol) is achieved by computing the top and
bottom quantile in standard deviation for our respective proxies. We
then pull the dates corresponding to the periods, and compute annualized
returns after geometrically chaining the monthly returns. The amount of
daily data for the respective interest rate cycles is large enough to
annualized, however, when the VIX, V2X or JALSH RV breach the top or
bottom quintile for less than 50 trading days, the period is excluded in
order to avoid annualizing small samples. To stratifying between Hiking,
Cutting and Neutral interest rate cycles we define these periods as
either 5 quarters of changes (upwards for Hiking and downwards for
Cutting) or otherwise if central bank held interest rates constant.

\subsection{When Do Dividend Strategies
Work}\label{when-do-dividend-strategies-work}}

The data presented in Table \ref{tab1} presents the excess cumulative
returns of our globally traded dividend portfolios of which cumulative
returns are indexed and start from value 1. On an aggregate level, most
portfolios yield a positive premium but below their starting point in
comparison to their corresponding market indices. Nevertheless, a
nuanced examination reveals a discernible variance in performance
between the high yield (HY) and dividend growth (DG) strategies. From
the UK proxy for dividend strategies, the UK\_HY surpasses its
comparables, delivering a cumulative return of 5.1 times the initial
investment over the sample period. In other regions, most high yield and
growth strategies fail give consistent cumulative returns from the
inception. It's pertinent to underscore, however, gains exhibited bu
other indicies other than the UK\_HY represent marginal gains when
contextualized within a 20-year investment horizon. Therefore, upon
assessing the cumulative returns, it becomes evident that there is not a
consistent indication that dividend strategies, irrespective of their
specific approach or geographical orientation, can consistently procure
a premium that, over time, translates into substantive value for
investors.

\end{table}

We then stratify the excess returns from the dividend portfolios
according to distinct interest rate regimes and equity market stability
cycles, a more refined understanding emerges regarding the efficacy of
dividend signals. Initially, interest rates are categorized into two
distinct cycles: the ``cutting'' cycle and the ``hiking'' cycle. These
cycles are defined by periods wherein sustained rate changes (a minimum
of five alterations) manifest at intervals of at least every five
quarters. Moreover, both implied and realized equity market volatilities
are leveraged to represent various episodes of market stability.
Subsequent to this stratification, we engage in the geometric chaining
of the excess returns across these varied periods, which are then
annualized. The resultant metric provides a comparative framework for
cumulative annualized returns. Table \ref{tab2} shows performance in
periods of heightened volatility (Hi Vol) or subdued (Lo vol) market
cycles. We immediately notice higher annualized excess returns in Lo vol
over Hi vol periods. Specifically, within regions, SA\_HY in Hi Vol ,
UK\_HY\_B in Lo Vol , US\_DG in Lo Vol , EM\_HY in Lo Vol , EU\_HY in Lo
Vol , JP\_HY in Lo Vol give the highest annualized excess returns. That
is, HY strategies in advanced economies give higher annualized excess
returns in low volatile markets over SA. We note that SA and Japan make
up the highest returns over the period in either HY or DG.

Table \ref{tab3} presents the performance metrics of various dividend
portfolios across different interest rate regimes, encompassing Hiking,
Cutting, and Neutral phases. The Federal Reserve Funds Rate serves as a
representative metric for the interest rate regime in emerging markets,
given the recognition that interest rate shifts in the US influence risk
appetites, thus determining capital flows between advanced and emerging
economies. For other indices, the local central bank interest rate
cycles are employed to ascertain their corresponding interest rate
regimes. Japan stands as an anomaly among these economies; absent
distinct hiking or cutting cycles, its central bank largely maintained
constant rates. Consequently, we assess its performance exclusively
within the confides of a neutral interest rate cycle.

Within geographies then, EM\_HY (Hiking), EU\_DG (Cutting), JP\_HY
(Neutral),SA\_DG (Hiking), UK\_HY\_B(Hiking), US\_DG(Hiking), perform
well in Hiking periods but their strategies are evenly split given our
sample. Therefore, there is no clear indication of which strategy works
best given the interest rate regime.

Investors are always considered with consistency when determining how to
allocate capital. For this we consider the information tratio. Figure
\ref{fig1} illustrates the consistency in the performance of dividend
portfolios by employing the rolling information ratio. The information
ratio serves as a measure of a portfolio's performance relative to a
market benchmark. It is frequently used in the industry to gauge a
manager's proficiency in generating excess returns and the consistency
with which these returns are achieved. Thus, our objective is to assess
the capacity of our dividend portfolios to achieve such excess returns.
We have adopted a rolling 60-month information ratio as a metric to
evaluate long-term performance consistency. This ratio is computed by
determining the rolling excess return of the index relative to its
benchmark and then dividing this by the volatility of those excess
returns.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{Much_Ado_About_Dividends_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \hfill{}

\caption{Rolling 3 Year Returns \label{fig1}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

Suppose we consider the red line to be a measure of a startegy
delivering acceptable returns over time. From this metric we notice that
the UK\_HY has delivered undesirable consistency in returns over the
sample period, thus had struggled to give the bang for buck effect and
harvest premiums for value equity overtime. The emerging market and
Japan portfolios had a polarizing performances throught the sample
period. For one, from 2005 to 2015, returns for the portfolio were
consistently positive. Since then, over the last 8 years rolling returns
for these portfolis have been negative. This constrasts South african
portfolios, of which dividend growth portfolios have since 2010 to 2020
have shown psotive information ratios. The SA\_HY only turned positive
since 2017. US and EU indexes have mirror intra geography performance.
In line with the results from our stratification based on market cycles
and interest rate regimes, we observed that the majority of HY
experienced declines in rolling information ratios, while DG portfolios
incurred losses. This trend was particularly evident during the period
following the global financial crisis in late 2008 to late 2009. This
period was characterized by high volatility and falling interest rates.
Conversely, the subsequent crisis, which occurred after the COVID-19
pandemic and was marked by rising interest rates, favored SA , JP and
EM, a (SA). These observations align with the major findings on the
influence of interest rates from the previous section.

Drawdowns give a more detailed picture of the risk attributes of the
constituents of a data series. Their importance for our study is to
uncover latent relationship between performance and drawdown.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics{Much_Ado_About_Dividends_files/figure-latex/Figure2-1} \hfill{}

\caption{Rolling 3 Year Returns \label{fig2}}\label{fig:Figure2}
\end{figure}

Our analysis in \ref[fig2] defines as the disparity between the peak and
trough values of cumulative excess returns within a specified time
frame. When scrutinizing our dividend portfolios, a pattern of
similarity emerges both geographically and across varied strategies.The
SA portfolios were markedly volatile, displaying the most pronounced
draw downs visually and more concretely by value from the beginning of
the sample period. This is closely followed by the UK High Yield (HY)
strategies. In contrast, portfolios associated with the EU and US
exhibit relatively milder draw downs. Yet, when the focus shifts from
mere magnitude to the distribution or dispersion of these drawdowns, the
narrative undergoes a transformation. The UK High Yield and Japan High
Yield strategies are revealed to be more volatile, being susceptible to
significant fluctuations. In juxtaposition, emerging markets, with South
Africa as a case in point, manifest a more stabilized profile, evidenced
by diminished variation in their drawdowns.

\hypertarget{taking-stock}{%
\subsection{Taking stock}\label{taking-stock}}

Over time, dividend portfolios, whether HY or DGPS, have exhibited
positive excess returns as indicated by cumulative returns. While the
UK\_HY index has shown the highest cumulative return, this trend is not
consistently observed across other regional indexes. Consequently, when
assessing the aggregate perspective on investor portfolio value,
dividend portfolios may not offer a reliable means to capture the value
premium consistently. However, upon stratifying these portfolios
according to different periods of market volatility, it becomes evident
that during low volatility periods, the primary determinant of
performance is not the geographical region but rather the specific
investment strategy employed. In this case, HY strategies. Surprisingly,
portfolios based in South Africa (SA) tend to perform well during these
high volatility periods, which is somewhat unconventional as such times
are typically associated with a flight to safety, and Emerging Markets
(EM) and, by extension, South Africa, are considered riskier. When
extending our analysis to encompass interest rate cycles, we observe a
contrasting effect compared to the volatility-based stratification. We
find that all strategies appear to give the highest return in hiking
cycles.

In assessing consistency, we employ the information ratio. Initially, we
discern that, at a broad level, dividend portfolios do not consistently
maintain a positive ratio over an extended investment horizon. However,
disparities in performance emerge. Notably, South African (SA) and
dividend indexes have consistently delivered positive ratios over the
past decade. In contrast, Emerging Markets (EM) and Japanese (JP)
indexes have experienced substantial declines in their information
ratios, despite seemingly consistent performance prior to 2015.
Meanwhile, the United States (US), European Union (EU), and United
Kingdom (UK) indexes have exhibited unpredictable performance over the
sampled period.

When we integrate our information ratio findings with drawdown analysis,
we observe that advanced economies have experienced the fewest drawdowns
over the sample period, with the exception of the UK. This could suggest
a relatively lower level of systematic risk in these economies.
Conversely, South African (SA) and Emerging Market (EM) drawdowns have
exhibited a declining trend, possibly indicating a reduced perception of
risk in emerging markets over time.
