# A dividend 

A dividend is a direct payment of capital from a firm to its shareholders. All dividends barring stock dividends reduce shareholder equity. The most common type of dividend is a cash dividend that is typically paid on a annual basis. A board of a corporation is responsible for dividend policy and once a dividend is declared it is a legal obligation thus becomes a liability on a companies balance sheet. 


## Why do firms pay dividends

To understand this we need to consider the dividend puzzle, which makes the argument that  dividends are a capital budgeting decision that reduce equity value when distributed to shareholders and should would decrease wealth for investors thus making them worse off. However, the answers are not so clear, as dividends may be a form of a reward paid to investors undertaking a risk (Black, 1976). Also dividends can be viewed as a return on investment other than selling share at a higher price at a given investment horizon. Naturally this resulted in opposing arguments trying to justifying  irrelevance and irrelevance of dividends payments. Proponents  opine that shareholders are indifferent about payments of dividends thus there exists no optimal dividend policy and that all policies are as good as each other (MM theory).However, the MM theorem doesn't consider real world market imperfections that may give relevance to payments of dividends. These constraints include but not limited to flotation, transaction costs suchs as taxes and floatation costs. Also, information asymmetry and principal agency. 

Tax preferences points to the client effect which states that different investors may be attracted to different stocks, as differing clients may have different tax treatments. In short investors buy stocks depending on their investment needs (Corporate Finance, 2001). This argument does have its flaws, as those that support the MM theorem point out that given diverse policies amongst a large number of firms, a change in policy should not lead to changing prices as clientele is substitute meaning that allocation decisions of firms occuer almost simultanaeously thus decisions or invest and disinvest in similar group of assets should on average result in zero net effect on the price. Empirically there has not been much eveidence supporting this therory. Flotation costs speak to the opportunity costs that a firm incurs when paying out dividends. Companies that pay out dividends forgo opportunities to expand business operations by using retained earnings, as this means that management will need to access financing that comes at a much higher costs from external sources. In a world where there are no flotation costs suggest by the MM theorem, management will be indifferent between issuing dividends and or borrowing from the market. 

Information asymmetry between shareholders and managers present a medium that conveys information otherwise private information. Investors therefore look for dividend announcements to assess the stock price of companies, thus signalling conveys information about the quality of a company (Corporate Finance, 2001). Typically investors compare dividends announcements to historical levels whilst considering company fundamentals. Too high or too low of a dividend will affect the share price and management knows about this. This presents the risk of manipulation from management that makes signal an imperfect signal for share prices. Extending the information asymmetry argument gives rise to the principal agency problem, where management and shareholders may have differing goals as how to use retained earnings that often leads to a conflict. The free cash flow hpothesis, supports that payments of dividends forces management to raise capital from outside sources and because of higher costs of borrowing and scrutiny from capital markets, reduces management ability to make suboptimal investments.  


# When Would Dividends Matter 

We now step away from the why onto the when - thus studying whether dividend payments as a signal can have informative return predictive value (irrespective of whether it is due to a value- or cash-flow management proxy, or through a direct preference premium
