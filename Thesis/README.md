# Objective

The goal is to assess the performance of dividend yield as an investment
strategy. I plan to use optimized portfolios of the highest paying
dividend stock and/or highest growth in dividends for a group of assets.

-   First calculate the excess returns for indices and their benchmarks
-   Explain relationships within the return series for each region with
    and without stratifying the sample.
-   Then maybe look to build own dividend portfolios to see how that
    would have performed.

# Instruments

The global dividend portfolios considered in the table below are sourced
from various literature from a practitioner perspective. They represent
stylized portfolio constructed from respective market indexes. Using a
similar approach I will consider broad market indices that are used to
construct the dividend portfolios listed below.
