# Intro

The goal is to assess the performance of dividend yield as an investment
stretgy. I plan to use optimized portfolios of the highest paying
dividend stock and/or highest grwoth in dividends for a group of assets.

# Dividend Growth and High Yield Portfloios

Passive equity investment offers transparent, investable and a
rules-based approach, avoiding the need to identify mispriced securities
commonly associated with active portfolio construction. To construct
dividend growth or high yield portfolio, we also need to select
benchmarks to which to compare performance against. Therefore I will use
broad market indices from which I will select the highest dividend
paying stock or growth in dividends stock according to a set of rules.
In conclusion, we will be using a factor portfolio (value) using a
return oriented strategy (HY and/or DGPS) to invested our primary goal.

# Instruments under consideration

-   Standard and Poor’s Dividend Aristocrats indexes: these indexes
    measure the performance of companies that have a history of
    consistently increasing dividends on an equal weighted basis; years
    of required dividend growth varies across countries. Against a
    benchmark of the broad S&P index.

-   MSCI High Dividend Yield indexes: the MSCI high dividend yield
    indexes are designed to measure the performance of companies with
    high dividend yields. The indexes exclude companies that do not
    exhibit dividend sustainability, persistence and quality.
    Constituents are first screened for deteriorating fundamentals, thus
    attempting to explicitly avoid associated ‘yield traps’.
    Constituents are then weighted by size. The performance of this
    index in measured against the broad MSCI index

-   FTSE Dividend Plus indexes (UK and SA only): the constituents of the
    Divi Plus indexes are chosen based on the one-year dividend per
    share forecast and are sourced from a third party data provider
    (INET in South Africa). Constituent weights are determined by
    forward dividend yields. The UK index comprises of 50 constituents
    whereas the SA index comprises of 30 constituents. This will be
    measured against

The Dividend Aristocrats indexes are thus constructed using DPSG
strategies, whereas both the MSCI and FTSE indexes use measures of
yield. Figure 3 shows the cumulative monthly excess returns of the
selected indexes relative to the universe benchmark from which
constituents are chosen.

# Cumulative Returns

The cumulative monthly excess returns of each of these indexes relative
to their respective benchmarks can be seen below.

The figure above is not entirely suggestive of a clear and consistent
out-performance or under-performance of dividend strategies over the
entire considered period, whether using DY or DPSG, globally.
