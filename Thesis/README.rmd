# Roadmap

The goal is to assess the performance of dividend yield as an investment strategy. I plan to use optimized portfolios of the highest paying dividend stock and/or highest growth in dividends for a group of assets. However, first I want to calculate all cumulative returns for all indexes and their benchmarks. 

##  Approach to Use

Passive equity investment offers transparent, investable and a rules-based approach, avoiding the need to identify mispriced securities commonly associated with active portfolio construction. Before we build our own portfolios I will compare performance indexes against their benchmarks across the globally.

I will present this in tabular form showing a comparison between index and benchmark. 

After this I will build global dividend portfolios by sector and assess whether there performance offers superior excess return over the generic geographical option that we often see practitioners construct.
